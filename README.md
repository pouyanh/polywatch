# Usage
Create the config file, run `polywatch` & it runs the command(s) when changes happen

# Configuration
Configuration is done using a single file named `.pw`. Extension can be `json`, `toml`, `yml`, `yaml`, `hcl` & `ini`.
It have to be located in **current working directory**.
[Example](pw.example.yml) yaml config file can be a proper starting point.

# Todo
1. Implement fsnotify watch method
2. Support multiline commands
3. Support event filters like filters on operation scope
4. Consider kill timeout
5. Add wildcard filter type
